# Milestones

## M0 — Project foundation

- [x] Establish Rust workspace
- [x] Separate scientific core from renderer
- [x] Add a thin native Explorer host
- [x] Document architecture and boundaries

## M1 — Graphics foundation

- [x] Create a native window using winit
- [x] Initialize wgpu instance, adapter, device, and queue
- [x] Create and configure a presentation surface
- [x] Clear the surface through a render pass
- [x] Handle window resizing and zero-sized surfaces
- [x] Handle close requests and surface acquisition states
- [x] Compile on Windows MSVC
- [x] Run on a Windows machine with a supported GPU
- [x] Verify resize/minimize/restore behavior on real hardware
- [x] Verify clean window exit

M1 was locally validated on the user's Windows environment. User-reported
checks passed, the Explorer window opened, and resizing/minimize/restore/close
behaved as expected. The visible clear color is intentionally a very dark
blue-gray. These results have not been independently reproduced here.

## M2 — Spatial foundation

Objective: establish a graphics-independent mathematical model for spatial
coordinates and camera transforms before introducing scientific geometry.

### M2.1 — Coordinate semantics and math foundation

- [x] Select glam for f64 vector/matrix/quaternion primitives
- [x] Declare glam centrally and inherit it in svf-core
- [x] Define right-handed world axes (+Y up)
- [x] Distinguish world points from displacement vectors
- [x] Verify implementation with local Windows workspace checks and tests

### M2.2 — Transform semantics

- [x] Document column-vector multiplication and column-major storage
- [x] Add a composition-order unit test
- [x] Verify transform convention tests locally
- [ ] Add further typed world/view transform APIs if required by later geometry

User-reported Windows validation:
- `cargo check --workspace`: passed.
- `cargo test -p svf-core`: passed.
- `cargo test --workspace`: passed.

### M2.3 — Camera and projection

- [x] Camera and projection implementation
- [x] Glam 0.34 camera API compatibility
- [x] Local Windows `cargo test -p svf-core`: 14 passed, 0 failed (user-reported)
- [x] Local Windows `cargo check --workspace`: passed (user-reported)
- [x] Local Windows `cargo test --workspace`: passed (user-reported)

The combined camera test expects NDC depth 0.88 for its chosen world target at view distance 5 with near=1 and far=11. Camera constructors use `glam::dcamera::rh` APIs.

- [x] Define validated look-at camera pose
- [x] Derive right-handed world-to-view matrix
- [x] Implement validated perspective projection with [0, 1] NDC depth
- [x] Implement validated orthographic projection with [0, 1] NDC depth
- [x] Add perspective aspect-ratio update without mutating camera/world state
- [x] Combine view and projection matrices in documented order
- [x] Add tests for degenerate camera configurations
- [x] Add tests for projection bounds and invalid parameters
- [x] Verify implementation with local Windows workspace checks and tests (user-reported)

### M2.4 — Renderer integration

Implementation committed; local validation pending.

- [x] Convert camera matrices to renderer representation explicitly (f64 to f32 at GPU uniform boundary)
- [x] Render reference axes and an XZ-plane world grid with a minimal line pipeline
- [x] Update perspective aspect ratio and camera uniform on non-zero resize without changing world geometry
- [ ] Verify workspace compilation and tests on Windows
- [ ] Verify visible axes/grid and resize behavior on real hardware

## M3 — Scientific geometry

- points, line segments, polylines
- indexed triangle meshes
- explicit topology validation
- CPU-side geometry tests

## M4 — Mathematical sampling

- bounded domains and sampling strategies
- function sampling with invalid-value handling
- surface mesh generation
- sampling density and error considerations

## M5 — Interactive surface demonstrator

- render `z = A * sin(x) * cos(y)`
- adjust A and regenerate only affected geometry
- inspect a selected point and recover its source coordinates/value
